# Particle Magic Mirror Port
This repository shows how to use the open source [Magic Mirror](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) project with [Particle for Linux](https://www.particle.io/linux/).

Particle for Linux allows you to easily push changes to your fleet of Linux devices from a host development computer. You can view the application status, connect via remote shell, and manage networks on the device all from the Particle Console.
